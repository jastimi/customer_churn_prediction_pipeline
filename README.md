# Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

This project demonstrates a full data engineering workflow to predict customer churn using PySpark and AWS-like components.
The pipeline simulates extracting customer data from an S3 bucket, performing ETL in Spark, and applying a simple churn prediction model.
Results are stored in Redshift-like tables for BI and reporting.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Use Case

Churn prediction helps companies proactively identify customers at risk of leaving. This enables targeted retention campaigns and boosts customer lifetime value.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- PySpark (Spark SQL, DataFrame API)
- Simulated AWS S3 (local filesystem)
- Simulated Redshift (output CSV)
- Scikit-learn (logistic regression model)
- Pandas for post-processing
